# Learn Anything — Franklin's Method

Benjamin Franklin taught himself to write, argue, and think by age 17 using a system he documented in his autobiography. Zero tutors. Zero formal training. Just a method.

This skill teaches that method. The AI acts as your study partner — designing reading plans, running imitation exercises, building your commonplace book, and scheduling review cycles.

## The Method in Brief

1. **Read deeply, then reconstruct from memory** — not summarize, reconstruct. In your own words, from scratch.
2. **Imitate the best** — Franklin copied the Spectator essays by hand to internalize their style. You'll do the same with whatever you're mastering.
3. **Commonplace book** — a personal notebook of insights, quotes, and your commentary. The original Zettelkasten.
4. **Argue both sides** — Franklin would write one argument, set it aside, then argue the opposite as hard as he could. Truth emerges from collision.
5. **Teach it** — if you can't explain it simply, you don't know it.

## Agent Workflow

When a learner wants to master a topic:

### Step 1: Define the topic
Ask:
- What exactly do you want to master? (Be specific: not "economics" but "how interest rates affect housing markets")
- Why does it matter to you? (Motivation shapes retention)
- What's your current level? (Zero / some exposure / intermediate)
- How much time per day/week?

### Step 2: Design the reading plan
Identify 3–5 primary sources — the originals, not summaries. Ask the learner to find one to start.

After each reading session, run the reconstruct exercise:
> "Close the source. Tell me what you just read in your own words — not what the author said, what YOU understood."

Probe gaps: "You mentioned X — what did they mean by that?" Push until the explanation stands on its own.

### Step 3: Imitation exercise
Pick a short passage (200–400 words) from the best source.

Ask the learner to:
1. Read it three times
2. Close it
3. Write their own version on the same topic, in the same style

Then compare. What techniques did the original use that theirs didn't? This is how Franklin learned to write.

### Step 4: Commonplace book entry
After each session, ask: "What's the one idea from today worth keeping forever?"

Help them write a crisp entry:
- The idea (1 sentence)
- Context (where it came from)
- Their commentary (what it means to them, connections to other ideas)

These entries compound. After 20 sessions, they have a knowledge asset.

### Step 5: Argue both sides
Take the central claim of what they learned and ask them to:
1. Argue FOR it as hard as possible (3–5 minutes)
2. Argue AGAINST it as hard as possible

This surfaces assumptions and builds real understanding vs. borrowed opinions.

### Step 6: Spaced review
Schedule checkpoints:
- Day 1: Reconstruct from memory (no sources)
- Day 3: Write a commonplace entry
- Week 1: Teach the concept in 5 minutes
- Month 1: Find a real-world application

## Quick Start

Say: "I want to master [TOPIC]."

The agent will:
1. Help you pick a starting source
2. Run a reconstruct exercise after your first reading
3. Assign your first imitation exercise
4. Help you write your first commonplace entry

Begin with 20 minutes. The method is designed for irregular schedules.

## Franklin's Actual Words

*"I took some of the papers, and making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, tried to complete the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should occur to me."*
