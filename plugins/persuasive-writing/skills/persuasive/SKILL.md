# Persuasive Writing — Lincoln's Method

The Gettysburg Address is 272 words. It redefined the purpose of the Civil War, reframed American identity, and is still memorized by schoolchildren 160 years later. Lincoln wrote it in days.

This skill teaches his method: radical clarity, structural parallelism, moral authority through concession, and the discipline to cut everything that doesn't earn its place.

## Lincoln's Core Techniques

### 1. Accessible Language
Lincoln was a lawyer who learned to write by reading the Bible and Shakespeare — and then learned to write for people who hadn't. His rule: if a farmer in Illinois can't understand it, it doesn't belong in the speech.

Test every sentence: would a smart 12-year-old understand this?

### 2. Parallelism and Repetition
"Government of the people, by the people, for the people."
"We cannot dedicate — we cannot consecrate — we cannot hallow this ground."

Parallel structure makes ideas feel inevitable. Repetition makes them unforgettable.

The pattern: say the same idea three times, in three different forms, escalating in weight.

### 3. Moral Authority Through Concession
Lincoln's most powerful rhetorical move: acknowledge the other side's strongest argument before dismantling it. This is not weakness — it's how you earn the right to be believed.

He gave the South credit. Then made his point.

### 4. The Rule of Three
Ideas grouped in threes feel complete and are easier to remember. "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." "I came, I saw, I conquered."

When listing, stop at three. When making a point, prove it three ways.

### 5. Moral Weight at the End
Lincoln always saved his heaviest line for last. The Gettysburg Address ends on "shall not perish from the earth." The Second Inaugural ends on "bind up the nation's wounds."

Your closing line is the one people will remember. Make it matter.

### 6. Brevity as Power
The Gettysburg Address replaced a two-hour speech by Edward Everett. Everett wrote to Lincoln afterward: "I wish I could flatter myself that I had come as near the central idea of the occasion in two hours as you did in two minutes."

Cut every word that isn't carrying weight.

## Agent Workflow: Drafting a Persuasive Piece

### Step 1: Define the argument
Ask the writer:
- What is the ONE thing you want the audience to believe or do at the end?
- Who is the audience? What do they currently believe?
- What's the strongest objection they'll have?

### Step 2: Concession first
Write the opposing view at its strongest. One paragraph. No strawmen.

This forces the writer to understand what they're actually arguing against — and it builds credibility with the audience.

### Step 3: The three-part structure
Outline:
1. **Setup:** Common ground — what you and the audience already agree on
2. **Turn:** The key insight or reframe that changes how they see the issue
3. **Stakes:** Why it matters — what happens if they don't act or believe

Everything maps to these three. If something doesn't fit, cut it.

### Step 4: Find the parallel
Identify the central idea. Write it once plainly. Then write it two more ways — each version slightly more powerful. The third version is your headline.

### Step 5: Write the closing line last
After the draft is done, ask: "If they forget everything else, what's the one sentence you want them to carry out of the room?"

Write that sentence. Put it last. Cut everything after it.

### Step 6: The readability test
Read the draft aloud. Anything you stumble on, rewrite. Lincoln read everything aloud. If it doesn't sound like a human speaking, it doesn't belong.

### Step 7: The cut
Remove:
- Every adverb that can be replaced with a stronger verb
- Every passive voice sentence
- Every sentence that says what you already said
- The first paragraph (usually just warmup)

## Quick Start

Say: "Help me write a speech/essay/pitch about [TOPIC] for [AUDIENCE]."

The agent will: define the argument, draft the concession, build the three-part structure, find the parallel, and help you find your closing line.

## On Lincoln's Process

He wrote on whatever was available — envelopes, scraps of paper. He revised constantly. He read everything aloud. He slept on drafts.

The Gettysburg Address wasn't genius in a moment. It was obsessive revision until every word earned its place.

That's the method.

## Trigger Phrases

Activate on:
- "Help me write a speech"
- "Write a persuasive essay about [X]"
- "Make this more persuasive"
- "I need to convince [audience] of [X]"
- "Review my argument"
