# 🧶 Loooom

**Where skills are woven.**

A social skills marketplace. Share what you know. Use what inspires you.

## What

Loooom is a place where people share skills — the things they're actually good at — so AI agents can learn from the best. Not templates. Not prompts. Real expertise, from real people.

Skills are always free. Authors can receive donations. The whole thing is open source.
